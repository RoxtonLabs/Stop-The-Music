# Stop-The-Music
Chrome extension to pause active YouTube videos. Packaged version can be installed here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stop-the-music/mmkciobbhadaepjnfjllinlemhcmiihc

One of my favourite things about the internet is how easy it makes it to be culturally decadent. For example, I spent Friday morning listening to the 1953 Tosca while writing some trivial VBA data analytics stuff. It was like using the Bayeux Tapestry as a bedspread. However, the downside to having one YouTube tab open among a score or more of StackOverflow and MSDN pages is that when one's manager demands attention it can be hard to pause quickly. So, an extension.

Press once to pause, press again to resume. Pausing affects all active YouTube videos; playing only affects the right-most tab (in my experience that's the most likely to be the most recent). 

Right-click the app icon and choose "Set keyboard shortcut" to choose a keyboard shortcut. Set the shortcut to "Global" if you want it to work from another application.
